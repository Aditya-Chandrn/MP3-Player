## Hi ! This is a college project, where I made an MP3 Player. 
### This MP3 Player was made using Python.

To get the theme that was used, download the file `clamTheme.tcl`.\
To get the icons used, download the png and ico files in `icons` folder.

### Modules used for this project :
- tkinter 
- pygame 
- filedialog 
- os 
- tinytag 
- time

## A screenshot of the player :
